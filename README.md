Tajawal is a distinctive modern Arabic typeface, available in seven weights. 
The range was created by the Boutros International foundry, following a modern geometric style while still respecting Arabic calligraphy rules. 

Its fluid geometry makes Tajawal the perfect choice to use in both print and web applications, and alongside its matching Latin typefaces.
